# web-encrypt-text
Demo of web-based encryption and decryption running from open source with open hosting on Github.

The code is just a tiny bit of HTML/CSS (using Bootstrap) with a few lines of JavaScript and using the included xxtea JS library. So all of it is transparent and meant to be inspected by any web developer to see how it works and that there's no hidden backdoors. Future versions will support other encryption algorithms.

[Actual web demo hosted with GitHub pages at tomosaigon.github.io](https://tomosaigon.github.io/web-encrypt-text/)

## 1st Demo: XXTEA
